<h2>Negative Time Solving Contest 2016</h3>
<p>
It's that time of the year again! For those in the Northern hemisphere, this is your only chance of the year to solve a cube in negative time as daylight saving (DST) ends and time falls back one hour. DST (Daylight Saving Time) ends October 29th in many countries in Europe. In most parts of the United States and Canada, DST ends at 2am on Sunday, November 5. See <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/events.html">timeanddate.com</a> to check the clock change schedule in your area.

<h3>The Contest</h3>
<p>
This challenge statement from 2004 by then-Caltech undergrad Tyson Mao pretty much explains it (original forum post).

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>There is only one day of the year where one can leave the drudgery of Caltech academic life and sprint off for a chili burger, chili dog, and chili fries in a timely manner. A very timely manner indeed... so timely that one can actually return before he departs.</p>
<p>This is the way of the Negative-Time Tommy's run. On one day of the year, a little bit before the first 2 AM, Caltech students hop in their cars and make a dash for the original Tommy's in Beverly Hills for some items with a lot of chili. The goal is to simply return before you left. If you are skilled, you may attempt the trifecta which consists of the burger with extra chili, the hot dog with extra chili, and the fries with extra chili.</p>
<p>Last year, I missed achieving negative time because of an accident on Highway 101. Our total time was 4 minutes. Of course, last year, I did achieve negative time cubing at a time of negative 59 minutes and 1 second. (I was not very fast back then.)</p>
<p>I challenge all of you to take part in the negative time solving tradition. We will have a website with the one, yes only ONE scramble which you will use for this entire year. The date I believe will be October 31, 2004.</p>
